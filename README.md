# Oilwell-repository
This dataset contains a real industrial production dataset.
The dataset was provided by one of a major oil and gas-producing city-forming company in one of the regions of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The analyzed data contains production information about oil production in the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 March 2022.  
Due to the fact that production data, as well as any other information obtained through processing, generalization, or analytical calculations, is equated to confidential information of the company owner. In this data, the name of the oilfield, the operator of the oil production, and well-by-well information remain anonymous.
